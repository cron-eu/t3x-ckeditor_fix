TYPO3 ckeditor Chrome / Safari fix
==================================

The style selectors in the new ckeditor in TYPO3 8 makes your browser window
scroll up and position the selector somewhere else (in Chrome / Safari ). This
extension adds a workaround proposed by Benjamin Franzke in the issue tracker,
wrapped in an extension for convenient installation.
